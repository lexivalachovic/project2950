    "## Derek Sanderson Jeter is an American former professional baseball shortstop, businessman, and baseball executive. As a player, Jeter spent his entire 20-year MLB career with the New York Yankees. Nicknamed \"The Captain\", Derek Jeter is soon to be inducted into the MLB Hall of Fame. There's no denying he was an amazing player, arguably the best player to ever play the shortstop position. But in baseball, there's two sides to the game. We will analyze Derek Jeter's batting performance over his career to see if he can really be the jack of all trades."

    "RSLT - Result: Win or Loss, tracks whether the baseball game played was a win or a loss for the team\n",
    "\n",
    "H - hits, tracks how many hits Derek Jeter had in a given game. A hit, also called a base hit, is credited to a batter when the batter safely reaches or passes first base after hitting the ball into fair territory, without the benefit of an error or a fielder's choice\n",
    "\n",
    "HR - home runs, tracks how many home runs Derek Jeter had in a given game. A home run is scored when the ball is hit in such a way that the batter is able to circle the bases and reach home safely in one play without any errors being committed by the defensive team in the process\n",
    "\n",
    "SB - stolen base, tracks how many bases Derek Jeter had in a given game. A stolen base occurs when a baserunner advances by taking a base to which he isn't entitled. This generally occurs when a pitcher is throwing a pitch, but it can also occur while the pitcher still has the ball or is attempting a pickoff, or as the catcher is throwing the ball back to the pitcher.\n",
    "\n",
    "BB - base on balls (walk) tracks how many walks Derek Jeter had in a given game. A base on balls, also known as a walk, occurs in baseball when a batter receives four pitches that the umpire calls balls, and is in turn awarded first base without the possibility of being called out\n",

He was an outstanding player and these statistics were compiled together after each game, each season to allow MLB fans to look back on the result and statistics of the game, and to look at the individual players success.\n",
    "\n",
    "What processes might have influenced what data was observed and recorded and what was not?\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Any data that is considered a significant play is recorded. Whenever a player gets a hit, a homerun, times up to bat, etc. The dataset that we are utilizing is a batting log, so only plays that happen while up to bat or on base are recorded.\n",

    "What preprocessing was done, and how did the data come to be in the form that you are using?\n",
    "\n",
    "-- The only preprocessed variable in our usage of the dataset is the WPA, win probability added. This is calculated using the data collected throughout the game. We included this in our dataset to compare how much the variables we choose contributed to the actual win probability added.\n",

    "To collect our data, we scraped online databases of baseball statistics in order to pull all of Derek Jeter’s in game statistics on a game by game basis for every game of his career ranging from 1995 to 2014. This data contained all of his batting statistics including variables such as OPS, BA, CS, GDP, SH, SF, HBP, SO, IBB, RE24, cWPA, and other such acronyms relating to baseball measurements. However, not all of these variables are applicable or comparable in regards to the type of inferences we are trying to make. Thus, in our data cleaning process, we first evaluated which of the variables would be appropriate and comparable for our studies. We came up with a final list of variables including year, home runs, hits, game result, stolen bases, base on balls, and win probability added. These variables are unique in that they are recorded on a game by game basis and do not accumulate, unlike some of the other variables that were included in the stat sheet. Then, with these specific statistics chosen, we cleaned the data by simply excluding the statistics that we did not want, and then combining the statistics that we did want into a single dataframe which is easily processable and neat. Through this process, we cut our dataset from 38 columns over 19 dataframes to a more readable six columns all in one dataframe. \n"

This dataset could include many other statistics if it were to be complete and provide the best, most accurate conclusions, but due to the difficulty of processing so many variables and the time constraints of this project, we chose only the most important ones. There is the possibility that there is human error in recording the information, and it is possible that the older statistics from 1995 are not as precise as the ones gathered more recently, given new technology in sports statistic reporting and recording. \n"

    "Win probability added is a sport statistic which attempts to measure a player's contribution to a win by figuring the factor by which each specific play made by that player has altered the outcome of a game. So we know Jeter made a contribution to the wins over the 20 seasons he played. Looking at the mean WPA of 0.011262, the positive value shows that on average he contributed to a win. This value is extremely low and close to zero, but it also is taking all 20 years and 2,747 games into account. So for that length of time having any positive value is impressive. This number has some limitations as a win or loss is not soley based on Jeter's performance. But as we continue to analyze his statistics we can further prove he made a positive contribution to the New York Yankees over his 20 seasons."
