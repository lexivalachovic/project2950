    "To collect our data, we scraped online databases of baseball statistics in order to pull all of Derek Jeterâ€™s in game statistics on a game by game basis for every game of his career ranging from 1995 to 2014. This data contained all of his batting statistics including variables such as OPS, BA, CS, GDP, SH, SF, HBP, SO, IBB, RE24, cWPA, and other such acronyms relating to baseball measurements. However, not all of these variables are applicable or comparable in regards to the type of inferences we are trying to make. Thus, in our data cleaning process, we first evaluated which of the variables would be appropriate and comparable for our studies. We came up with a final list of variables including year, home runs, hits, game result, stolen bases, base on balls, and win probability added. These variables are unique in that they are recorded on a game by game basis and do not accumulate, unlike some of the other variables that were included in the stat sheet. Then, with these specific statistics chosen, we cleaned the data by simply excluding the statistics that we did not want, and then combining the statistics that we did want into a single dataframe which is easily processable and neat. Through this process, we cut our dataset from 38 columns over 19 dataframes to a more readable six columns all in one dataframe."

    "With this funciton, I processed 20 different CSV files, each of a different year of Derek Jeter's career, and concatenated them into one CSV file. I went through this consolidated CSV afterwards in order to cealn up some formatting/encoding erros by hand. This resulted in a single CSV sheet of all the games Derek Jeter played in his career. With this function, I was also able to process 22 different CSV files, each of a different year of Alex Rodriguez's career, and concatenate them into one CSV file. I had to go through the consolidated CSV afterwards in order to clean up some formatting/encoding errors, where the beginning year of each new year of Rodriguez's career had a non-unicode compatible symbol. I deleted these errors by hand to result in a single CSV sheet of all the games Rodriguez played in his career."

    "This function allows the fast cleaning of data tables (which contain a lot of stats that we are not utilizing in our examination of each player) and cuts down on the amount of repetitive code. This code pulls out a select number of columns, including the result of the game (Rslt), hits (H), homeruns (HR), walks (BB), and win percentage added (WPA). In addition, this function adds a column called 'win' to the resultant dataframe, which reads the Rslt column and adds a 1 to the column if there is a W under Rslt, and adds a 0 if there is a L under Rslt."
